# Link Stack

A place to stack your links, instead of having them flood your bookmarks. View live and try it out at [http://stack.snilius.com](http://stack.snilius.com). Until further notice you can even continue to use my hosted version if you like. Just log in with Google, do notice that I will collect your e-mail address if you login. This is just so that I can send you a e-mail if things changes.
