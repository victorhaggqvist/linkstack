<p>Link Stack was created to reduce the overflow of tabs and bookmarks in my the
webbrowser. I wanted an easy way to just stack links up but still beeing able to
navigate them with ease when I might just remenber the context.</p>

<p>Feel free to try it out your self right now here, ATM there it only support
for OpenID auth with Google. Or you could grab a copy and host it your self.</p>

<p>I do not leav any warranty of that this hosting will last forever, but I collect your
e-mail when you sign in to I will notify you if things changes.</p>
